# PS4-Real-Time-Memory-Editor
Introduction
-------------
PS4 Real Time Memory Editor for Linux for retail consoles.

Read/Write in a game memory to create mods like PS3 with tmapi and ccapi.

This version a little demo.

I will improve the system with a graphic interface and the possibility of read and write arrays. I will release a windows/linux library to work with this easily.

Thanks to @TheoryWrong for answer my noob questions.
